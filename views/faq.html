        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>How many usernames can I block at once?</h2>
        <p>
          Anecdotally, it seems like blocking more than about 20 or 30 accounts
          at a time tends to result in a lot of skipped ones. I'm looking into
          ways to fix that, but it's tricky so it may be a while.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Can I paste in a list of screen names with stuff like "@/" and "@." in
          front of them?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Yes. Blockasaurus ignores all special characters. It looks for valid
          twitter handles and skips everything else. Newlines, spaces, commas,
          @-symbols, dots, slashes, whatever. A valid Twitter handle is any
          contiguous string of 4 to 15 characters that consist solely of
          underscores, letters, and /or numbers.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Can I block accounts by numerical user ID instead of @-screenname?
        </h2>
        <p>Not at this time, no.</p>
        <h2>
          Why does Blockasaurus ask you to authenticate your Twitter account
          again every time you use it?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because it doesn't store your credentials so it doesn't remember you.
          This also means there is no storage for bad actors to hack into.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Why does Blockasaurus ask for so many permissions to do stuff in my
          Twitter account?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Twitter doesn't have fine-grained access controls. They should but
          they don't. The permissions list you see on the authentication screen
          is what Twitter calls "read/write" access, which is the only way
          Twitter allows an app to block accounts for you.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Why should I trust Blockasaurus not to do something bad with my
          account credentials?
        </h2>
        <h3>Trust is earned</h3>
        <p>
          You should be skeptical of every application that you use for
          interacting with your Twitter account, and use your best judgement
          about which app creators you trust. Blockasaurus is maintained by me,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeSondow">@JoeSondow</a>, and it's your
          decision whether to trust me. If you know me you might find me
          trustworthy. If not, read on for options.
        </p>
        <h3>Revoke permissions</h3>
        <p>
          It's a good idea to
          <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"
            >remove any lingering application permissions</a>
          that you no longer need from your Twitter account. You can safely do
          this after each use of Blockasaurus if you like. Maybe delete a few
          others you don't need anymore while you're in there too.
        </p>
        <h3>Options that don't require trusting me include:</h3>
        <h3>Code review</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://glitch.com/~blockasaurus">Read the source code</a>,
          or ask a JavaScript-savvy friend to read it for you. Check that it
          doesn't do anything bad.
        </p>
        <h3>Roll your own</h3>
        <p>
          Remix the application by clicking the fishies in the upper right
          corner and clicking "Remix on Glitch". This will give you your own
          copy of the code to modify, and your own Glitch application URL.
          <a href="https://apps.twitter.com"
            >Register your own Twitter application</a>
          with a callback URL matching your Glitch app with "/access-token"
          appended to the URL. Next, get your Twitter app's credentials and put
          them in the .env file of your Glitch app. Now you have your own
          version of Blockasaurus that does not interact with anything I have
          access to. As a bonus, you can also modify your version to suit your
          liking.
