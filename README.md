Blockasaurus ðŸ¦–
=================

What's this?
------------

This blocks all the twitter accounts you submit in the form all at once and allows you to report them as spam if you so choose.

Why?
----

Because sometimes people on the internet can be unpleasant and/or scary and you might not want to deal with that manually.

Usage
-----

You can login with your Twitter account to grant read/write API access for your account to the Blockasaurus Twitter Application. Alternatively, you can register your own Twitter Application. Go to [blockasaurus.glitch.me](https://blockasaurus.glitch.me/), add your Twitter credentials (Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, Access Token Secret), put the list of twitter screennames you want to block in the blocklist textarea, press the block button and you're done!
